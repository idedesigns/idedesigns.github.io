Vinyl planks will absorb none of that moisture, so you won’t have to worry about them warping or swelling.

This means helping to keep spills and humidity to a minimum, so there’s less chance that it will affect the floor. And unlike most other bathroom flooring choices, wood floors can be periodically refinished and resealed, increasing their practicality.
