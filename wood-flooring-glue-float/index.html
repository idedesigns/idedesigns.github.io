<p>As the natural wood it is good and also easier to install and maintain. But if your flooring is engineered wood, iâve learned that you can just use a nail or something to make sure it stands on its own. Glue down as an installation method for wood floors involves using a bonding agent, adhesive or glue that you put directly on to your subfloor before laying your floor. In the long run, this leads to higher mechanical stress and thus to material fatigue at the element connections.</p>
