The Evolution of Engineered Hardwood Flooring From builddirect.com
Simply put, engineered hardwood is a type of real wood flooring made up of a composite core (usually plywood) with a solid wood veneer on top. The best way to avoid popping noise is most importantly by allowing the wood to acclimate to the house and always nail properly down to the subfloor as well as using the right sized fasteners. The plywood used in the midsections consists of layers typically crisscrossed and bonded together. The result is a locking plank system with actual hardwood with less cost.
