Successful installation also requires conducting a concrete slab moisture test before parquet installation. Wood floors should not be subjected to very wet conditions. When you are knowledgeable about how concrete works and how it interacts with hardwood flooring, you will be prepared to install a beautiful floor over concrete. Moisture can pose problems for solid hardwood floors below ground level, so engineered wood floors (made of layers of wood glued together) are the best choice there.
