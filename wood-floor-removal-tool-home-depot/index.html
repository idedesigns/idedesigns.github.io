QEP 14 in. Wide Floor Surface Scraper and Stripper20900Q From homedepot.com
The home depot we have now been using the diamabrush™ products within our flooring business for over 3 months now and cannot believe how such an unpleasant job of preparing a floor for floor coverings has now become almost pleasant. Our flooring is about 3/4 inches thick, so i set the blade depth about 3/4 inches deep, so that the blade cut through the hardwood floors, without cutting into the plywood subfloor. Carpet tape, razor blades, tack strips, and knee kickers are a few of the essential carpet tools needed to complete the job. First, set the blade depth on your circular saw.
