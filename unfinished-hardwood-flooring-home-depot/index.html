Hardwood flooring is created from a single plank of wood and is appropriate for installation in any above ground room in the house. The reserve series features an antiqued finishing and staining process with far more vivid color and depth to accent each wire brushed plank. Depending upon your selections, the total cost for hardwood floor installation, including labor and materials, can average up to $4 to $6 per square foot. Our collection of unfinished solid wood flooring is one of the largest on the web, and perhaps the most competitively priced collection anywhere!
