Hardwood Flooring Edmonton Ashley Fine Floors From ashleyfinefloors.com
From a rustic cabin feel to a look of timeless elegance, hardwood is one of the most popular flooring options available today. From mills around the world, your floor will have the unique look of oak, maple, birch, walnut, cherry and ash that are available in several different grades and widths. This means that the floor is cut from a single source of wood. Hardwood floors are available in maple or red oak and unlike other types of flooring, solid hardwood floors can be refinished rather than replaced to adapt to changing trends.
