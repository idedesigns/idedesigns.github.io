Nails will not hold onto the osb through the hardwood floor and will come loose in a couple of years causing uneveness, which is a very dangerous situation to try to walk over. As such, the more material will resist moisture the better. Osb has much weaker adhesion to construction adhesives when you bond the panels down. Osb (oriented strand board) is made from large, flat chips arranged in as many as 50 layers, which are adhered together with glues and pressed into sheets.

<p>What can be done to prevent loose fasteners in osb? Wood structural panels suitable for use as subflooring material should be plywood or oriented strand board (osb) with a bond classification of exposure 1 or exterior. Hardwood flooring will not stabilize the osb subfloor, so all movement must be remedied prior to hardwood installation. As a whole osb is not the best material to use underneath a hardwood floor but it will work fine provided you install it correctly and follow the manufacturerâs recommendations.

<p>One nwfa recommended policy is to use a moisture meter on at least 20 locations on the osb subfloor per 93 m 2 (1000 sf), and average the results. Itâs perhaps the best after plywood. You can also use screws to remove a squeak in the subfloor caused by the subfloor moving against the nails. An easy test for moisture from a basement floor would be to tape plastic squares to various areas of the concrete and left for a day or so to see if condensation develops on the plastic.

The conditions for the flexibility to run it parallel with the floor joists depend on the existing subfloor's thickness is Â¾ and that there is no deflection found when walked on. Similar to having plywood as a subfloor, the most recommended way to install either engineered or solid wood onto an osb subfloor is secret nailing or stapling. That's why smooth faced plywood (subfloor grade) is required for nail/cleat/staple/glue down wood floors. Pin by Jaqueline Trujillo on Design Ideas Osb, Plywood.</p>
