Dog Shoes Boots with Mesh Nonslip Rubber From amazon.com
I have a 15 yr old dog that does incredibly well for her age (never messes.) as of late, she is having a hard time on the hardwood floors and now stays on the carpet and doesn’t want to walk on the floors. While the occasional slip might not cause much concern, and can even be a little comical, falls present the risk for serious injury, especially for senior dogs. The best dog socks for hardwood floors stay securely on feet and have nonslip grips to give paws firm footing. There are several things you can do to help an old dog slipping on hardwood floors in your home, other than removing your beautiful hardwood floor.
