Bruce Take Home Sample Hickory Rustic Natural Engineered From homedepot.com
Engineered hardwood is made with a real wood veneer and, in most cases, waterproof layers. The top layer of the material is solid hardwood while the base layers are designed to give the material greater stability and resistance to moisture. Both solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring come in a vast array of wood species, surface treatments, stain colors and plank sizes. The unmatched beauty that species such as oak and maple, among others, give a home is one of the many reasons why builddirect clients continue to renovate their spaces with this timeless flooring option.
