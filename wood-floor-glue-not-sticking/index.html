Moisture is usually expressed in pounds per 1000 square feet per 24 hours. If your thinset or tile adhesive isn’t sticking to the floor tiles, there’s usually a single culprit. Without resanding, waxes, oils, and furniture polishes used to clean wood floors seep into the pores of the finish and can prevent the new finish from bonding successfully.
