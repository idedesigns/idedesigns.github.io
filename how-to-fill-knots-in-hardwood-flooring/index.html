Wood floor business vacuuming is preferable to sweeping as it allows the dirt as well as dust to be pulled from between the boards, but use a vacuum with a bare flooring attachment, not a beater bar, which can damage the wood. If you’re looking to highlight the knot, use epoxy, adding a bit of black chalk to the mix before application. If the flooring will be stained, you can add some of the stain to this mixture as well. I would do a sample and make sure you like the appearance of the knot after the surface is sanded and oiled.
