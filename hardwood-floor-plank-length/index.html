Question about length of hardwood flooring planks. Now, we are installing hardwood floor which comes in 5 (if not 6) different length. For engineered and laminate planks that come in boxes usually in the same length (mostly 36 inches), when installing them, you will need to cut the planks at the ends of each row to length, but no planks in between can be cut. Are these short planks normal?
