What&#39;s Better Solid vs Engineered Hardwood Flooring LV From lvflooring.ca
The janka scale, which is from 0 to 4,000, rates red oak at 1,290, which makes it an easily workable flooring that is ideal for being treated with stains, lacquers, and protective sealants. Once you factor in the costs of a finishing treatment, then prefinished flooring actually ends up being cheaper. However, you will save a significant amount of time or money on the installation when compared with unfinished flooring. Prefinished solid wood floors initially cost more than unfinished wood flooring—about $2 per square foot for a good grade of red oak.
