What is the right thickness of Vinyl flooring for me From globalvinyl.lk

When it comes to 8mm vs 12mm laminate there are significant differences though. It usually made of a hardwood species, such as oak, maple, or walnut, and its major advantage is that it can be sanded and refinished many times over the course of its lifespan.
