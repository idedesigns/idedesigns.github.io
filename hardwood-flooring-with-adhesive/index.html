<p>The glue down method of laying hardwood floors is one of the original methods of installing hardwood flooring. The bostik laybond wood floor adhesive can be applied to rigid flooring grade plywood, however the plywood will need priming first with the bostik cempolay universal primer which is a water based acrylic that is diluted with water at a ratio of 2 parts water to 1 part primer by volume and this is applied to the plywood and allowed to dry before applying the adhesive. Most floating floors out there today don't use adhesives.
