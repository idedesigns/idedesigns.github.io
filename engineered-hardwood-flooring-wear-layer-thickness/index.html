Engineered Wood Flooring Thick Wear Layer Carpet Vidalondon From carpet.vidalondon.net
The thickness of the wear layer on engineered hardwood flooring varies from product to product. A very popular thickness for a high quality engineered hardwood floor is 4mm. It’s slightly thicker at 4mm with an 8mil wear layer while the bottom sample is shaw matrix at 3.2mm thick with a 6mil wear. Engineered flooring is typically between 3/8” to 3/4” thick, whereas solid hardwood is 1/2” to 3/4“ thick.
