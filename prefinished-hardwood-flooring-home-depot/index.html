Light floors with a white or blue tint bring a coastal look to a home. Our prefinished hardwood selection will soon be the largest and most diverse collection of prefinished hardwood flooring on the web. A prefinished hardwood floor is still solid, real wood flooring, after all, so the surface can be sanded and a new stain and sealer applied, just as with a traditionally finished wood floor. Brazilian wood depot mills hardwood planks into the most beautiful and the most durable hardwood flooring in the world and provides this at a cost less than most engineered, prefinished or oak plank flooring.
