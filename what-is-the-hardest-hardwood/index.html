What are the hardest woods? Quora From quora.com
Hard maple ranks 1,450, while red oak ranks 1,290. With a fine and uniform texture, straight grain, and natural strength and stability, hard maple has excellent resistance to abrasion and wear, making it ideal for cutting boards and chopping blocks. Softwoods such as fir, pine, and hemlock rarely work well as flooring materials, except in a shop or utility area. To put you in perspective, the hardest commercially sold wood is pecan hickory, measuring at 8,096 n or 1820 lbf.
